# GM:S2 Snippet Maker

GameMaker:Studio 2 allows you to create custom code snippets as described [here](https://help.yoyogames.com/hc/en-us/articles/360022531011-How-To-Create-a-Custom-Code-Snippets-File). However, in order to create a code snippet, you'd have to format it in a certain way. This includes getting rid of all the new lines and converting the code into one single line (with several additional characters). With smaller amounts of code this can be manageable, but with bigger code snippets this goes out of control. 

This community tool can help you with generating those formatted code snippets from existing files with minimal effort. Just select a file containing your code snippet, add a snippet name and key and with a press of a single button all your code is generated and ready to be coppied.
